The application can be started by following the steps given below:

1. Click on ProgressBarDemo.war, then click on View Raw. This downloads the WAR file.
2. Open the WAR and double click on index.html

Note: If you are unable to unzip the WAR, you need to rename the extension with .zip and then extract the zipped folder. 
You would be able to open index.html file.

The WAR has not been made as an executable since the application has only static content and no java code. Hence packaged into a WAR that can be extracted to view the project demo.
